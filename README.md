Ensuring Code Functionality and Security
Achieving functionality and security in code is no easy feat. In my recent course, I delved deep into code testing and sometimes found it overwhelming to ensure everything operated flawlessly. It was only during this course that I truly grasped the depth of the task. Adhering to specified requirements and conducting thorough tests that yield a high coverage percentage is crucial. In my project for the course, I rigorously tested until I achieved a coverage of at least 90%. While the foundation for functionality lies in following the requirements, security is fortified through meticulous testing based on those same requirements.

Interpreting User Needs for Programming
To integrate user needs into a program, I first analyze and then deconstruct them to determine compatibility. Consider constraints like maximum length and null submissions. In one instance, names couldn't be null or exceed 10 characters. To incorporate this, I used an 'if' statement addressing both conditions. Such direct translations from user needs to code conditions are straightforward. However, there are often nuanced requirements that demand a more intricate approach. For example, a task in another class required the software to add time to two clocks simultaneously at the push of a button. The translation of this requirement into the code was more complex than just inserting an exception.

Software Design Approach
My strategy for software design is ever-evolving. Typically, I start by reviewing the requirements document or interview transcripts when available. This allows me to formulate a checklist of key tasks. If applicable, I segment these tasks into necessary objects and corresponding methods. Armed with these lists, I commence coding to fulfill the outlined requirements. After achieving a working code, I retrospectively optimize for efficiency. While this method has served me well academically, I acknowledge the potential for further refinement and depth in my approach.
